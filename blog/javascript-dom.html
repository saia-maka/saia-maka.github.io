              What is the differences between HTML and CSS?
            </p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              HTML is all the content that you see on a webpage. The
              text, titles, images, videos etc. CSS is the styling and it
              determines how it all looks, where it all goes and how it fits all
              together eg what font the text will be, what size the titles are
              and what color they may be, how big or small an image is and where
              to display a video.
              <br>
              <br>
              Every piece of content must be displayed in a
              sensible manner that is presentable and easy for us to find and
              navigate. CSS dictates the positioning and styling of all the
              content.

              I've never designed a shirt before but I can imagine it's
              similar. Your text and picture you're wanting to put on your shirt
              is like HTML eg It's a picture of a brick wall and the text says
              something like "Street Kiwi". You can put it on your shirt as it
              is but it won't look very nice because it needs some stylin!
              Choosing what font your gonna use, what color text you'll use, how
              big you picture will be and where its gonna sit on the shirt is
              exactly like how CSS fits with HTML. HTML is the content. CSS is
              the styling of the content!

              What is the differences between HTML and CSS?
            </p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              HTML is all the content that you see on a webpage. The text,
              titles, images, videos etc. CSS is the styling and it determines
              how it all looks, where it all goes and how it fits all together
              eg what font the text will be, what size the titles are and what
              color they may be, how big or small an image is and where to
              display a video.
              <br />
              <br />
              Every piece of content must be displayed in a sensible manner that
              is presentable and easy for us to find and navigate. CSS dictates
              the positioning and styling of all the content.
              <br />
              <br />
              I've never designed a shirt before but I can imagine it's similar.
              Your text and picture you're wanting to put on your shirt is like
              HTML eg It's a picture of a brick wall and the text says something
              like "Street Kiwi". You can put it on your shirt as it is but it
              won't look very nice because it needs some stylin! Choosing what
              font your gonna use, what color text you'll use, how big you
              picture will be and where its gonna sit on the shirt is exactly
              like how CSS fits with HTML. HTML is the content. CSS is the
              styling of the content!

            <p class="post-questions">What is control flow and loops?</p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              An easy way to think of control flow and loops would be to think
              of how you fold your clothes and put them away in your drawers.
              The goal is have our clothes folded and put away nicely in our
              drawers. Since we're working with computers we have to tell it how
              to do it and create a process for the computer to follow. In every
              process there are steps and if the steps are not followed
              correctly we know that the outcome is often not correct either.
              <br />
              <br />
              For example, if we just picked up our clothes and put them
              straight into our drawers there would be a few issues: the clothes
              probably wont all fit and you probably wont be able to close or
              open your drawers. We need to pick up each piece of clothing, fold
              it, sort where it going to go and then put it away. So when were
              giving the computer the instructions or steps to follow we have to
              make sure we structure the steps/instructions correctly in order
              to achieve the correct outcome. This is called control flow.
              <br />
              <br />
              During our process we sometimes come to a point where we need to
              repeat a certain process. In programming we try to avoid using
              repetitive code so that's where loops come in! We can use loops to
              repeat a process in a few lines of code rather than lines and
              lines of code repeating ourselves. We can simply create a loop and
              say - pick up a piece of clothing, fold it and put it here. Keep
              doing this until there are no more clothes left in the basket.
              Done!

              What is the DOM and how do you interact with it?
            </p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              The Document Object Model or DOM is a tree of objects that
              represent the html of a webpage. Each piece of html in the webpage
              is a separate object and are nested within each other or branch
              off each other. It's hard to imagine but think of it as a family
              tree. There are parents and their children branch off of them in
              the family tree. Its the same sort of thing with html elements -
              they can have other elements nested within them/branched off of
              them. They are called parent elements and child elements, and it
              continues as the sort of next generations are created.
              <br />
              <br />
              That's what the DOM is and looks like - but what its used for is
              to allow developers to target certain content or elements in the
              tree and manipulate. Creating elements using html/css is like
              making a light switch. You can put there and make it look nice but
              without some wiring(logic/javascript) it doesn't do anything its
              just like a decoration. The light swtich would be one of many
              objects with the tree and the DOM allows us to find and
              select/target the specific object we want to work on, in this case
              the light switch, and then use javascript to manipulate it eg turn
              it on, turn off or even make it disappear!

            <p class="post-questions">
              Whats the difference between accessing data in arrays and objects?
            </p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              Data accessed from arrays is accessed using indexes. If you had an
              array of colors eg:
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong> let arrColors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']; </strong>
              <br />
              <br />
              To access a color (or data from within the array) you'd have to
              use the index of where it is in the array. The index of blue would
              be 2 because indexes start from 0 - so to access it you'd do so
              like this:
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>
                arrColors[2]
              </strong>
              <br />
              <br />
              Objects have key value pairs meaning each piece of data within the
              object has a key and each key has a value eg:
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>
              let obj= {
              <br />
              name: 'Saia',
              <br />
              age: 26,
              <br />
              favColor: 'black'
              <br />
              }
              </strong>
              <br />
              <br />
              For objects you wouldn't access the data stored within them using
              indexes, you would use the dot operator ('.' - simply a dot)
              followed by the name of the key you're trying access. If you
              wanted to access the the name data inside the "obj" object you
              would do so like this:
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>
                obj.name
              </strong>
              <br />
              <br />
              If you assigned this to a variable and console.log it:
              <br />
              <strong>
                let myName = obj.name
              </strong>
              <br />
              <strong>
                console.log(myName)
              </strong>
              <br />
              <br />
              It would display 'Saia'.
              <br />
              So when you access data in arrays you use indexes and when
              accessing data in objects you use the dot operator followed by the
              name of the key your trying to access. For objects you can also
              use the square bracket enclosed with the name of the key inside a
              string eg:
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>
                obj['name']
              </strong>
            </p>

              What are functions and why are they useful?
            </p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              Functions are a set of statements in javascript that execute a
              task. Functions are awesome they're like tools that you can design
              to complete a task and then re-use as many times as you need. When
              you're building your code you need different tools to accomplish
              different tasks.
              <br />
              <br />
              So once you know what you need to do or what the task is that you
              need to complete, you build a tool(or a function in our case) that
              can do the job that you need done. Sometimes you will need to do
              the same job again or maybe a few times more? Functions are really
              useful because once you've built one you can call its name again
              anywhere in your code(as long as it's after where you built/write
              it) and it will re-do its job however many times you need it to!

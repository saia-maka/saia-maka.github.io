            <p class="post-questions">How do I solve a problem?</p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              Some might say 'you just solve it and get on with it?', I said the
              same thing in the past. Now having had more life experience I'd
              say the first step to solving a problem is knowing what the
              problem actually is? And like any problem, it can be broken down
              into smaller problems that collectively fixed, will solve the
              original problem you had.

            <p class="post-questions">Name a problem that I had?</p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              A problem that I had recently was when I was working with some
              data that essentially was a grade book containing the names and
              grade scores of 4 students. I had to write a program that would
              find the grade scores of any student of choice and calculate an
              average of their scores.
            </p>

          <div class="blog-post-txt-wrapper">
            <p class="post-questions">What happened next?</p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              I jumped straight into it and wrote some code that flowed off the
              top of my brain and ran it through the machine. It didn't work so
              I played with the code for a while until I realized I had a
              problem and I was stuck! The first step I took to solve this was
              to figure out what my problem was: At first it was that I wasn't
              able to access the student's scores. When I used the rubber ducky
              technique (telling & talking to myself about what I was trying to
              do/doing) and dived deeper into my problem I quickly realized I
              had more problems: I could access the student's score but the code
              I wrote was wrong (obviously), I didn't know for sure what I was
              doing anymore and I couldn't tell which stages of my code were
              broken.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="blog-post-txt-wrapper">
            <p class="post-questions">So how did I solve the problem then?</p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              Next, I jumped onto google and ran a couple of searches to read
              different codes to figure out how to actually use the code and to
              learn how to to access the data I couldn't access before. Then I
              had to write out some steps to follow (psuedocode) so that I could
              figure out where I was going with my code again and what I was
              doing. Finally, I used console logs (alert messages) to see which
              parts of my code weren't working. Now that I had a plan of how to
              approach the problem and had found the appropriate tools &
              knowledge to attack back with, I quickly got back on track, made a
              few adjustments, and got through the challenge!

          <div class="blog-post-txt-wrapper">
            <p class="post-questions">How did it feel and what did I learn?</p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              I did feel a little frustrated initially and especially when I
              started to lose track of what I was actually trying to do and when
              I couldn't the data I needed. Like most situations you get
              familiar with, you don't panic and sort of just know you'll get
              through it. I knew I just had to take it slow and find the right
              way to approach the challenge. It felt good getting through and
              felt good to see my problem-solving skills improving.

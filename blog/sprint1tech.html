              Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the
              process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do
              you believe what it said?
            </p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              Yes I did, it was saying that maybe I wouldn't be able to complete
              the whole course because my tendencies to fall off in the past. I
              don't believe it because I wouldn't have made it here to the Dev
              Academy if it were true. The past is the past, I only learn from
              it now. Im moving forward and I have to believe I can do it!

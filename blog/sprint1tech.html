            <p class="post-answers">
              Yes I did, it was saying that maybe I wouldn't be able to complete the whole course because my tendencies to fall
              off in the past. I don't believe it because I wouldn't have made it here to the Dev Academy if it were true.
              The past is the past, I only learn from it now. Im moving forward and I have to believe I can do it!

            <p class="post-answers">
              Neuroplasticity is the ability of neural networks in the brain to
              grow and change through repetition of habits and continuous review
              of information.

              Understanding how our brain learns and being conscious of it will
              maximize our brain's performance and essentially our learning
              performance. Repetition is the key to building neuroplasticity.
              The more we practice something or the more we review information -
              the more neuron pathways are created forming stronger connections
              making the task we're practicing or info were learning become like
              second nature to us.

              Whats my own experience with neuroplasticity?
            </p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              I've had some experience with it not knowing about it or without
              knowing that was even a thing? But it definitely works and from my
              own experiences I know this to be true! It happens but we don't
              really notice it as an actually thing - in laymans terms we call
              it 'you got better at it' or 'experience'. In the brief research I
              completed this is actually neuroplasticity.
              <br />
              <br />
              Ever remember playing a game that you really enjoyed in your
              childhood and when you start playing it, its a little hard
              figuring out how the game works and how to play. But the longer
              you played, and the more often you played the better you got at
              it? Thats neuroplasticity! And did you notice when you haven't
              played for a while you get a little rusty at it? Thats
              neuroplasticity again!
              <br />
              <br />
              The more you practice something the more neural pathways are
              formed in your brain, the less you practice something the more
              neural pathways are pruned!

            <p class="post-questions">What is the Growth-mindset?</p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              The growth mindset is the belief that one's abilities/qualities,
              specifically intelligence, can be developed.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="blog-post-txt-wrapper">
            <p class="post-questions">How does this become helpful?</p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              This is empowering for individuals to understand that they can
              become better at something rather than having been born with a
              limited or fixed amount of intelligence/skills.
            </p>

          <div class="blog-post-txt-wrapper">
            <p class="post-questions">
              Whats my own experience with the Growth-mindset?
            </p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              I read Carol Dweck's Mindset book last year (2021) and it helped
              me to understand how I had a fixed mindset and how it came about.
              It damaged my learning experience growing up in school and
              essentially helped me believe that I wasn't capable of learning or
              thriving at school.
              <br />
              <br />
              Learning about the fixed mindset and growth mindset helped me
              understand that difficulty learning something doesn't imply that
              I'm not capable or intelligent but rather a challenge that will
              help me grow and that in fact, challenges are completely normal
              and everyone experiences them.
              <br />
              <br />
              So as I continue my learning journey not only in the Dev Academy
              but also in life, I will keep building a growth mindset and
              approach learning with the growth mindset to keep developing
              myself and to continue discovering the best version of myself.

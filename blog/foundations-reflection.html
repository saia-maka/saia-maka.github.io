              What are three new things I have learned about myself and my ego due to the core learning?
            </p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              #1 I learned what ego is and that I had quite a big one! 
              <br>
              #2 I learned that ive been too self-critical and that I cant continue to 
              let it limit how I live my life anymore. Ive learned to jump only so high due to that 
              voice in my head so I need to unlearn that and jump as high as I can to be my best self and grow.
              <br>
              #3 I learned that I actually love to engage and interact with others but ive just been too self-critical
               and had too big of an ego to make an effort to socialize with others, to work with others and to be open to others.

              What is the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
            </p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              I'm not exactly sure, to be honest, I'm figuring it out as I learn and grow. I think they help to
              understand how to work and how to learn. We're all different and by building an understanding of each
               other and ourselves we can build our emotional intelligence and ability to grow. 
               I believe this will also reflect in our programming.

              	What has surprised me the most about the core learning?
            </p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              I'm surprised at how much I have grown in the short time we've done it as a result of it! It has even 
              helped me outside of work too in my personal life. It has opened my eyes to a list of things I need to work on as
               I continue my learning journey after foundations.

              What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            </p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              For me, there were two.
	            The first was asking myself tough questions about my ego, if I had one and if yes how was it affecting me etc. 
 	            Having to be honest with myself and facing it.
	            The second was pairing up with others in the class to do the listening and looping exercise. 
              I thought I was scared and had some sort of anxieties about it all but in the end, I feel it is just being too 
              self-critical and letting that voice get the better of me.

              Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
            </p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              Technical skills are only half of the job as a developer. Sometimes maybe even less than half. The rest of the job is 
              being able to work in a team, working with others, and the rest of the soft skills. And as stated in the handbook: 
              "Tech employers aren't looking for top grades or the person with the most outstanding code. They're looking for exceptional 
              human beings who will enhance the culture of their team".

              Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
              Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.
            </p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              No. After 5 sprints I feel like it has enhanced my programming and understanding of it. 
              We know that programming is essentially problem-solving and the core learning has helped me understand programming problems 
              in a different way than I would've otherwise. Problems aren't really problems they're more like different people or
              conflicting personalities. When we're coding it's not that we need to get rid of the problems but rather 
              help the problems to grow and work together. Initially, they don't connect and don't work together. 
              But the logic we build to make the code work is like building empathy between each other to help everyone connect, 
              understand each other and work together. The different problems in code need empathy and understanding of itself in the context of others!

              Saia's learning plan for Mataī Dev Academy 2022
            </p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              My long term goal is to become a software engineer and to run a
              business developing/distributing software and web applications.
              <br />
              <br />
              I like to think that I keep an open mind with most things in life.
              I'm always open to feedback and I'm open to different points of
              views which I believe helps me adjust to different environments,
              different personalities, learning new things or adopting new
              beliefs, and also helps to challenge my own knowledge and beliefs.
              I'm also quite a humble person which I feel is a really great
              strength but sometimes I know I deflect praise and as I've learnt
              already in foundations is that I need to accept it as it will help
              build my confidence. I have a great work ethic and can persevere
              during hard times. To assist that I need to work on organising
              myself more and not getting distracted so that I can get the most
              out of my learning and bring the best out of myself.
              <br />
              <br />
              As I have mentioned I struggle to reach out for help, however I
              will commit myself to growing out of this habit/behaviour. When I
              need help or when I don't understand something I will put my hand
              up or I will ask for help from other students/facilitators in a
              timely way (after I've had a decent go myself), usually on discord
              or otherwise in person.
              <br />
              <br />
              I would love to develop my organisation skills as I believe it is
              key to maintaining success in learning, work and other areas of my
              life. I would also love to develop my shyness/openness to others.
              I struggle to reach out to people who can help, especially
              creating conversation with others and putting myself out there,
              and how to interact with others in a social setting. This is a
              huge piece that I feel I've been missing and struggling with for a
              long time so I would really appreciate working on this. I would
              also love to really step outside my comfort zone to work on my
              leadership skills - practice mentoring and being mentored, helping
              others learn and to practice taking a leadership role. Finally, I
              would love to work on my teamworking skills as working in a team
              is essential to working as a developer and will set me up for
              success in different teams in the future.
              <br />
              <br />
              It is my hope the facilitators can continue to help me adjust and
              prime myself to reach my goals, to set myself up for success in
              terms on staying on the right track with my study/work and to get
              the most out of this learning experience. Whether it be in the
              form of feedback, a casual conversation and or extra learning
              material they believe or can see is relevant to what I need, I'm
              more than happy to take it on board. I'll take any help I can get
              and will keep an open-mind.
              <br />
              <br />
              I do have whanau commitments as I'm a father but they are usually
              taken care of outside of my working hours or by my partner. If for
              some reason I need to take care of something or need to be excused
              I will let the appropriate people know as soon as I can.
              <br />
              <br />
              I will schedule specific times for myself for when I'm working and
              when I'm not. For example, times I will start for the day, times I
              will finish, and days I will be working. My family around me will
              be made aware and reminded of this commitment to help support and
              prime myself and my environment to enable me to work productively,
              safely and to the best of my ability. If and when I can help other
              students, I will make a decent effort to do so. If and when I need
              assistance from or to report to facilitators, I will also make a
              decent effort to do so. I will not put the safety of others at
              risk, I will treat others with respect and do my best to put my
              best foot forward at every stage of my learning.
              <br />
              <br />
              I will take brief moments to breath and calm myself to manage
              lesser challenging intensities of emotions or stress. For more
              challenging intensities I will take a timeout to step away, dust
              myself off, get some air into me, talk to a facilitator or call a
              support person or two, then return and communicate how I was
              feeling and why I had to step away. Otherwise, I will communicate
              to my facilitators how Im feeling and seek advice/assistance where
              appropriate.

            <p class="post-answers">
              My vision is that the skills I gain during this course will get my foot
               in the door as a full-stack developer in a prominent tech company.
                So that I may be able to gain exposure and further development to help me
                 progress as a developer into an eventual senior developer position. 
                 I believe this pathway will lead me to my long-term goal of starting a tech business
                developing and deploying software and apps.

            <p class="post-answers">
              My biggest strengths will be my past coding experience with Take2, my growth mindset, and the problem solving skills ive been developing in foundations. 
              My limitations have changed as I now believe my biggest limitations are my ego and the self-critical 
              voice inside my head. If I'm not careful to build on these weaknesses it will reflect in my interaction with my family, 
              facilitators, and peers, and stunt the growth that the dev academy experience has the potential for.

              I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be to manage and balance my life.

              A step further into that is my time management and organization skills. This will be an epic challenge!

            <p class="post-questions">What is emotion intelligence?</p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              Emotional intelligence is an individual's ability to perceive,
              control and evaluate emotions in themselves and to understand,
              interpret and respond to the emotions of others.

            <p class="post-questions">How is it different to IQ?</p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              EQ focuses on your emotional intelligence rather than how
              intelligent you are mentally. The difference can be thought of in
              many different ways, however one that helps me understand the
              difference is: IQ can be thought of as how 'smart' an individual
              is whereas EQ can be thought of as how 'mature' an individual is.
              IQ is a measure of our reasoning/problem solving ability to think
              logically. EQ is a measure of our ability to perceive,
              understand/evaluate and respond to our or other's emotions.

            <p class="post-questions">Why is it important?</p>
            <p class="post-answers">
              Improving EQ will help improve your health and well-being. It will
              help to you think before reacting, help to manage yourself safely
              and more effectively, help you to manage others safely and to show
              empathy, help you to deal with challenging situations more
              effectively and ultimately it will build a greater sense of
              self-awareness. These will improve how you interact and engage
              with yourself and others and will develop your
              leadership/teamworking skills.

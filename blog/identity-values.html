              Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to
              make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that
              decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your
              action?

              During my time on Take2, I and another student had the pleasure of
              planning a family day for our class that the CEO could pitch to
              get approved. While I'm sure the two of us could've come up with
              something spectacular, I knew we could come up with something even
              better if we included the entire class. So instead of leaving it
              to the two of us (Class Leaders), which we could've easily done,
              we planned everything together as a class. Some feedback we got
              afterwards was that it was a execellent plan. In the end this
              developed the class bond and culture as it created a sense of
              inclusiveness and responsibility for all.

              Discipline is a big part of my culture as a Tongan and I feel it
              strongly influenced values such a respect, humility and kindness.
              Any sort of signs of disrespect is heavily frowned upon and
              sometimes even met with physical discipline (considered on a
              case-by-case basis). Growing up in this culture helped me to be
              humble and to respect others, especially my parents, elders and
              others. It also taught me to be kind to others. It wasn't always
              pleasant as I was a difficult kid but I there were also many
              positives in the end.

              I think my strengths will help me to be a great student in the dev
              academy in terms of how I conduct myself and my approach towards
              learning. My limitations on the other hand, if I don't pay
              attention, will limit the growth and learning experience I will
              have throughout dev academy and in my career. Improving those
              limitations will help me develop as a student, a professional and
              as a person exponentially.

              Definitely approaching everything I do with a open-mind/growth
              mindset, progress isn't always a straightward line it goes down â¬‡

              myself/others, a positive and can do attitude will help me get the
              most out of my learning and help me continue to move and growth in
              the right direction.

              Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to
              work productively with others, but there was resistance or
              tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how
              effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies
              you would try now and why?

              During Take2 there was some feedback work we had to complete as
              part of a design workshop we did with Xero, our facilitator at the
              time asked some students in our class if they could re do their
              work as it was not up to a satisfactory standard to be sent
              through to Xero. The facilitator asked me to help some of the
              others since I had already completed mine. I felt some
              tension/resistance working with some of the students and was
              initially difficult working together. My strategy was to help them
              see the work in a different way, that it wasn't just any task we
              had to complete, but a opportunity to build rapport and that it
              would be a chance to start building their own reputation within
              the tech sector. It helped most take it more seriously but not all
              so next time i'd try being more patient and ask more questions to
              help build with better/improved strategies.
